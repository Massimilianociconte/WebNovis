# Free backlink opportunities for WebNovis: a ranked action plan

**WebNovis can build a powerful, free backlink profile across 100+ platforms — without spending a euro.** The opportunities below span Italian directories, international agency platforms, EEAT-building profiles, PR channels, social properties, and creative link sources. Each has been verified for free access and ranked by effort (easiest first), then by authority within each tier. The single most efficient action is registering on Pagine Gialle, which simultaneously creates listings on four high-authority Italian domains. Combined with Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, and a handful of agency directories offering dofollow links, WebNovis can establish a strong foundation in under 10 hours of work.

This guide covers 100+ opportunities organized into five effort tiers. Every entry includes the platform URL, free status, link type, authority rating, and step-by-step submission instructions.

## Tier 5: 1+ hours each — high-effort, high-reward plays

These require content creation, sustained engagement, or outreach but can deliver the most impactful results.

| # | Platform/Tactic | Link type | Authority | Instructions |
|---|----------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| 75 | **WordPress.org plugin/theme** ★ | **Dofollow** | **Very High** (DA 95) | Create WordPress.org account → develop and publish a free plugin (even a small SEO utility or widget) → add webnovis.com as author URL.

Use search operators: `site:.it "scrivi per noi"` + web design. Author bio typically includes dofollow link. |
| 77 | **Broken link building** | **Dofollow** (replaces editorial links) | **Variable** | Use free tools: Check My Links (Chrome extension), Ahrefs Free Broken Link Checker, Dead Link Checker → find broken links on Italian web design resource pages and tech blogs → check Wayback Machine for original content → create similar/better content on webnovis.com → email site owners suggesting your replacement. Target Italian university pages and resource directories. |
| 78 | **Free tool creation** | **Dofollow** (natural editorial) | **High** | Build a free tool on webnovis.com: "Calcolatore SEO Gratuito," "Generatore Meta Tag," "Analizzatore Velocità Sito," or "Preventivo Sito Web Calculator" → submit to Italian resource pages and tool roundups.

| 80 | **Podcast creation** | Nofollow (directory links) + brand authority | **Very High** | Create Italian-language podcast on web design/SEO tips (very underserved niche) → distribute to Apple Podcasts (podcasters.apple.com), Spotify for Podcasters (podcasters.spotify.com), YouTube Music, Amazon Music → each directory creates a profile with website link. Even monthly 15-minute episodes build authority. |
| 81 | **University partnerships** | Nofollow (.edu domains) | **Very High** | If any team member is a Politecnico di Milano, Statale, or Bocconi alumnus → update alumni directory with business listing. Offer guest lectures or workshops → get linked from department pages. Create educational content professors can cite. |
| 82 | **Scholarship link building** | **Dofollow** (.edu domains) | **Very High** | Create scholarship page on webnovis.com ("WebNovis Borsa di Studio per il Web Design," even €500/year) → contact financial aid pages at Politecnico di Milano, IULM, Università Statale for listing.

| 85 | **Wikipedia citation** | Nofollow | **Highest** (DA 100) | Do NOT add direct links (will be removed as spam). Instead: publish original research or data on webnovis.com → find Wikipedia articles needing citations (e.g., articles on "Web design" or "SEO") → add your content as a legitimate reference. Requires establishing editorial trust. Very long-term play. |

## The 13 platforms that actually move the needle

Not all backlinks are equal. These are the **highest-impact free opportunities** based on the combination of authority, link type, and relevance to a web agency in Rho:

1. **Google Business Profile** — non-negotiable foundation for local SEO visibility
2. **Pagine Gialle (4-in-1)** — one registration, four high-DA Italian citations simultaneously
3. **WordPress.org plugin** — strongest developer EEAT signal; dofollow from DA 95
4. **GoodFirms** — free dofollow link from a verified agency directory
5. **DesignRush** — free dofollow link, strong for "web agency" search terms
6. **Digital Agency Network** — free dofollow, curated credibility
7. **Behance** — dofollow profile link from DA 93; essential for design EEAT
8. **GitHub organization** — DA 98 developer credibility; README dofollow links
9. **Google Developer Profile** — dofollow on Google's own DA-100 domain
10. **HARO pitches** — earned dofollow editorial links from major publications
11. **Connect.gt (Giorgio Tave)** — the most respected Italian SEO/webmaster community
12. **Italian guest posts** — dofollow author bio links on high-DA Italian sites
13. **Blogger/Blogspot** — Google-owned, fast-indexing, dofollow links in posts

---

## Trade associations and membership directories worth the fee

While not free, these **paid memberships** deliver high-authority institutional backlinks plus business benefits that justify the cost:

**CNA Milano** (cnamilano.it) and **Confartigianato Milano** (confartigianato.milano.it) both offer member directories with dofollow links on DA 55–65 institutional domains. Annual fees typically run €200–500 but include networking, tax assistance, and trade fair access. WebNovis qualifies under CNA's "CNA Professioni" or "CNA Comunicazione" categories. **Confcommercio Milano** and **Assolombarda** offer similar listings but at higher membership costs.

---

## Execution timeline and critical rules

**Week 1** (Tier 1 + top Tier 2): Set up all instant-win profiles plus Google Business Profile, Pagine Gialle, LinkedIn, Facebook, Trustpilot, Crunchbase, and the three dofollow agency directories (GoodFirms, DesignRush, DAN). Estimated time: **4–5 hours.**

**Week 2** (remaining Tier 2 + Tier 3 profiles): Complete remaining directories, create Behance portfolio, GitHub organization, Google Developer profile, Blogger blog, and begin Medium/Dev.to publishing. Estimated time: **4–5 hours.**

**Week 3–4** (Tier 4): Sign up for HARO, Featured.com, Qwoted → begin monitoring and pitching. Register on Connect.gt and HTML.it forums → start participating. Submit Italian press releases. Begin blog commenting on Italian tech blogs. Estimated time: **3–4 hours setup + ongoing.**

**Month 2+** (Tier 5): Develop WordPress.org plugin, pitch Italian guest posts, create free tool for webnovis.com, begin broken link building outreach. These are ongoing, high-reward activities.

Three rules govern the entire process. First, **NAP consistency is non-negotiable** — use the exact same business name, address format, and phone number (with country code) across every single listing. Even small variations ("Via" vs. "V.", "MI" vs. "Milano") hurt local SEO. Second, **spread profile creation across 3–4 weeks** to maintain natural link velocity — avoid building 50 profiles in one day. Third, **nofollow links still matter** — Google confirmed in 2019 that nofollow is now a "hint," not a directive, meaning high-DA nofollow links from platforms like LinkedIn (DA 98), YouTube (DA 100), and Trustpilot (DA 93) still contribute to brand authority and may pass partial equity.

## Conclusion

The landscape of free backlink opportunities for an Italian web agency is remarkably rich — over **100 viable platforms** exist across directories, agency listings, developer profiles, PR channels, and social properties. The critical insight is that **dofollow links from agency-specific directories** (GoodFirms, DesignRush, Digital Agency Network) and **developer platforms** (WordPress.org, GitHub, Google Developer, Dev.to, Behance) deliver disproportionate SEO value relative to effort. Meanwhile, Italy's concentrated directory ecosystem — where a single Pagine Gialle registration creates four high-DA citations — offers efficiency unmatched in most other countries. The overlooked goldmine is **earned editorial links** through the revived HARO, Featured.com, and Qwoted, where a web agency founder positioned as an SEO expert can land dofollow links from major publications with zero cost. For the Italian market specifically, active participation in the **Connect.gt community** and **guest posting on Italian marketing blogs** builds the geo-specific authority signals that Google increasingly weights in local rankings.
